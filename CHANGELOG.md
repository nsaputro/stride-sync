## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial repository scaffolding: `CLAUDE.md`, `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, and the `stridesync/` add-on
  folder layout (`config.yaml`, `build.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, `rootfs/`, `DOCS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  icon/logo placeholders).
- Garmin Connect sync client (`app/sync/garmin_client.py`): authenticates via `garmy` and fetches
  recent activities merged with per-activity distance/pace/cadence detail and per-lap splits.
  All failures (bad credentials, MFA, broken SSO, network/proxy errors) surface as
  `GarminAuthError`/`GarminAPIError` instead of raw library exceptions.
- SQLite schema (`app/db/schema.sql`) for `activities`, `activity_metrics` (per-lap time series),
  and `sync_log`.
- Manual sync CLI: `python3 -m app.sync.scheduler --once` — logs in, syncs recent activities and
  laps, and records the outcome in `sync_log` whether it succeeds or fails.
- Unit test suite (`stridesync/tests/`, 22 tests) covering schema creation, Garmin API response
  normalization, and the sync/log-on-failure path, run with `pytest`.
