# 🏃 StrideSync — Project Plan

**A Home Assistant add-on that syncs Garmin Connect running data and exposes it to Claude via MCP for conversational analysis**

---

## Vision

StrideSync keeps your Garmin Connect running data flowing into a database you own, running
continuously on the same server as the rest of your home automation — no laptop cron job, no
local-only setup, nothing to remember to start. It exposes that data to Claude (or any MCP
client) over the network so you can ask conversational questions about your training — cadence
trends, pace splits, heart-rate zones, training load — without opening a dashboard.

It is **read-only**: StrideSync never writes back to Garmin. It only reads activities and stores
them locally.

### Garmin Connect sync

- **Primary library**: [`garmy`](https://pypi.org/project/garmy/) for Garmin Connect
  authentication and activity sync.
- **Fallback**: [`python-garminconnect`](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect) if
  `garmy` cannot cover a needed endpoint or breaks in a way `garmy` doesn't recover from first.
  Both libraries sit behind the single `app/sync/garmin_client.py` interface (see `CLAUDE.md`) so
  swapping the underlying library is a one-file change, not a rewrite.
- Auth credentials (`garmin_username` / `garmin_password`) come from add-on options, never
  hardcoded or logged.

### Scheduled sync service

- Runs as its own **s6 service** (`rootfs/etc/services.d/sync-scheduler/run`), independent of the
  MCP server process.
- Interval is **configurable via `config.yaml`**, **default every 6 hours**.
- Writes normalized activity data (pace, cadence, HR series, distance, duration, training load
  metrics reported by Garmin) to a **local SQLite database** stored in the add-on's persistent
  `/data` volume (`/data/stridesync.db`), so it survives add-on restarts and updates.
- Each sync run records its own outcome (success / partial / failed, record count, error message)
  in a `sync_log` table — the MCP server can surface "last successful sync" and "last sync error"
  directly in conversation, rather than a user discovering stale data on their own.

### MCP server

- Built with [`fastmcp`](https://gofastmcp.com) directly (`app/mcp/server.py`), exposing five
  purpose-built tools (`recent_activities`, `activity_laps`, `pace_cadence_hr_trend`,
  `training_load_summary`, `last_sync_status`) on top of `app/db/schema.sql`, rather than
  [`garmy-mcp`](https://pypi.org/project/garmy-mcp/)'s bundled server — `garmy-mcp`'s
  schema-specific tool (`get_health_summary`) queries a `daily_health_metrics` table that doesn't
  exist in our schema, and this milestone wants purpose-built tools, not a generic
  run-arbitrary-SQL tool. This is the "equivalent MCP tool/resource layer built directly on the
  SQLite schema" fallback this section originally anticipated.
- Exposes **Streamable HTTP transport**, not stdio — this add-on runs on the Home Assistant
  server, not on the same machine as the Claude client, so an stdio-piped subprocess isn't an
  option. Modern `fastmcp` (the same library `garmy-mcp` itself depends on) serves Streamable
  HTTP **natively** via `mcp.run(transport="http", ...)` — no separate `mcp-proxy` process runs
  *inside* the add-on. (`mcp-proxy` is still used **client-side**, e.g. by Claude Desktop, to
  bridge its local stdio-only integration to this remote HTTP endpoint — see §2. That is a
  different process, on a different machine, doing a different job.)
- Runs as its own **s6 service** (`rootfs/etc/services.d/mcp-server/run`) on a **configurable
  port** (default `8765`), reading the sync scheduler's SQLite DB over a **read-only** connection
  (`sqlite3.connect("file:...?mode=ro", uri=True)`) — the MCP server must never be able to write
  to the sync scheduler's database.
- **Read-only**: exposes tools/resources for querying activities, trends, and summaries. No
  write-back to Garmin is planned initially (see Milestones — a future write-back milestone would
  need explicit user confirmation flows and is out of scope for v1.0).

### HA add-on configuration (`config.yaml` `options:` / `schema:`)

| Option | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `garmin_username` | Garmin Connect account email | — (required) |
| `garmin_password` | Garmin Connect account password | — (required, `password` schema type) |
| `sync_interval_hours` | How often the sync scheduler polls Garmin Connect | `6` |
| `mcp_port` | Port the MCP server listens on (Streamable HTTP) | `8765` |
| `log_level` | Log verbosity for both services | `info` |

All of the above are exposed in the HA Supervisor's add-on Configuration UI automatically once
declared in `config.yaml` — no separate UI code needed.

### Known risk: unofficial Garmin auth breakage

Garmin does not offer a public API for personal Connect data — every sync library in this space
(`garmy`, `python-garminconnect`, etc.) depends on reverse-engineered SSO/login flows that Garmin
can and does change without notice. **This already happened once**: in March 2026, Garmin put
Cloudflare in front of their SSO login, breaking unauthenticated scripted logins across the
ecosystem until the libraries adapted.

Design implications:

- **Fail loud, never silent.** A broken auth flow must produce a clear, actionable log line
  (`bashio::log.error`) and an entry in `sync_log` with `status = "failed"` and the underlying
  exception message — not a sync that silently no-ops and leaves the database looking current.
- **Surface staleness through the MCP server itself.** Any MCP tool that returns activity data
  should be able to report "last successful sync: N days ago" so a conversation with Claude
  surfaces the problem instead of Claude reasoning over stale data as if it were current.
- **No auto-retry storms.** If auth is broken, retrying every sync interval against a broken SSO
  flow risks the account being flagged for suspicious activity. Back off and log distinctly from
  "transient network failure" vs. "auth flow structurally broken, needs a library update." Applied
  concretely to the MFA case below: once a fresh login reveals an account needs MFA,
  `GarminClient` persists a marker (`.mfa_required` next to the token files) and fails fast on
  every later call while it's still set, instead of repeating a fresh SSO login attempt every
  `sync_interval_hours` forever — that attempt can't succeed without the one-time bootstrap
  anyway. Cleared automatically the next time a session is found valid.
- **Isolate the blast radius.** Because sync and MCP are separate s6 services, a broken Garmin
  auth flow degrades the sync scheduler only — the MCP server keeps serving whatever was last
  successfully synced, with clear staleness info, rather than the whole add-on going down.

**MFA/2FA accounts are supported via a one-time interactive login, not automatically.**
`garmy`'s SSO login doesn't raise an exception when an account requires MFA and no interactive
prompt callback is supplied (which StrideSync, running headless, never supplies) — it silently
returns a `("needs_mfa", state)` tuple instead. This surfaced for real (a user with MFA enabled
hit exactly this, and their account can't have MFA disabled). Two changes fixed it properly
rather than just reporting it more clearly:

1. `GarminClient.login()` no longer calls a fresh SSO login on every sync — a fresh login always
   re-runs the full flow, which would re-trigger MFA every single sync forever. It now checks
   for a cached session first (`AuthClient.is_authenticated`), then a refreshable one
   (`needs_refresh` → `refresh_tokens()`, which uses the long-lived OAuth1 token and does **not**
   need MFA), and only falls back to a fresh SSO login if neither exists.
2. `app/sync/bootstrap_login.py` — a one-time interactive CLI (`python3 -m
   app.sync.bootstrap_login`, run via `docker exec` or HA's Terminal & SSH add-on) that performs
   that first fresh login, prompts for the MFA code, and persists the resulting session to
   `garmin_token_dir` (`/data/.garmin_tokens`) — the same location `login()` checks first. Every
   scheduled sync afterward reuses/refreshes that session.

A **web-based MFA entry flow** through HA ingress — flagged by the same user who hit this, since
terminal access isn't something every HA user has set up — is now implemented too:
`app/mfa_web/server.py`, a small Starlette app reached at the add-on's ingress panel
(`ingress: true`/`ingress_port` in `config.yaml`, revisiting the v0.4 milestone's original "no
ingress" decision). It shares `app/sync/mfa_login.py`'s login/resume logic with the CLI bootstrap
above, so both entry points implement the flow exactly once. Login state (the pending
`("needs_mfa", state)` tuple) lives in a single in-process slot — correct because there is
exactly one Garmin account per add-on install — rather than a per-visitor session store.

**Confirmed against `garmy` via live testing — Garmin's Cloudflare bot management, not an
application-level rejection.** A real account hit `401 Client Error: Unauthorized` on the plain
SSO signin GET (`https://sso.garmin.com/sso/signin?id=gauth-widget...`) — *before* credentials
were even submitted. Copying the identical URL into a real mobile browser, on the same
account/network, succeeded instantly and completed the full login (including MFA). Two fixes,
in sequence, both needed:

1. `garmy`'s Android User-Agent (`garmy.core.config.UserAgents.ANDROID_APP`) is the literal
   Android package name `"com.garmin.android.apps.connectmobile"`, not a real User-Agent string
   (unlike garmy's own correctly-formatted iOS constant, `"GCM-iOS-5.12.24"`) — and identical
   across every garmy install, an easy fingerprint to single out. `garmy` doesn't expose a
   supported way to override this (its public `set_config()` only reaches one of the two places
   this UA is read from — see `app/sync/garmy_ua_override.py`'s module docstring), so
   `garmy_ua_override.apply()` patches both. **This alone did not resolve it** — confirmed by
   live retesting on a rebuilt image.
2. Retesting with enhanced error diagnostics (`describe_transport_error()` in
   `garmin_client.py`, appending response headers/body to transport-error messages) confirmed
   the real cause: `server=cloudflare`, a `cf-ray` header, and an HTML body with `class="no-js"`
   — a genuine Cloudflare bot-challenge page, which no amount of header tweaking can defeat since
   Cloudflare's bot management checks the TLS/JA3 handshake fingerprint itself, before any HTTP
   request is even sent. This is the same event already known ecosystem-wide: Garmin put
   Cloudflare in front of SSO in March 2026, which deprecated `garth` entirely (its maintainer
   couldn't work around it) and forced `python-garminconnect` to adopt `curl_cffi` (a
   `requests`-compatible client that can impersonate a real browser's TLS fingerprint) to stay
   working. `app/sync/garmy_tls_impersonation.py` applies the same fix to `garmy`'s SSO login
   flow specifically (not `APIClient`'s ordinary data-fetch requests, which aren't gated behind
   this rule) — see that module's docstring for the two `garmy`-internals compatibility gaps it
   has to patch around (`GarminOAuth1Session`'s `parent.adapters` access, and
   `curl_cffi`'s exception types not being `requests` exception subclasses).

3. **TLS impersonation alone still didn't clear it** — confirmed by live retesting (the error
   message's format changed from `requests`'s to `curl_cffi`'s, proving the new transport was
   actually used, but the same Cloudflare challenge came back). Investigated
   `python-garminconnect`'s actual current implementation directly: it does the same `curl_cffi`
   TLS impersonation *and* inserts a randomized delay (3-8 seconds for the same widget-flow login
   `garmy` uses) between fetching the login page and submitting credentials — treating request
   *timing* as a separate Cloudflare signal from the TLS handshake itself. New
   `app/sync/garmy_login_delay.py` reproduces this by patching `garmy.auth.sso`'s
   `_perform_initial_login` (the credential-submitting POST) to sleep first, matching the
   GET-then-wait-then-POST pattern rather than firing both back-to-back.

Still not verified end-to-end against a live account from this environment (no route to
`garmin.com` here) — awaiting confirmation from a real HA install. Three fix attempts in a row
for the same underlying block (UA, TLS fingerprint, timing) — if this one *also* doesn't clear
it, that would point toward an actual JavaScript challenge (the response body's `class="no-js"`
is consistent with this), which no plain HTTP client — regardless of headers, TLS fingerprint, or
timing — can solve without real browser automation (Playwright/Selenium), a much larger change.

**Watch item, unconfirmed against `garmy`:** a separate, newer Garmin-side auth problem
surfaced in the wider unofficial-client ecosystem starting ~June 2026 —
[python-garminconnect#369](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect/issues/369) and
[garth#137](https://github.com/matin/garth/issues/137) both report login succeeding but a
subsequent API call returning `401 Token is not active`, suggesting Garmin changed server-side
bearer-token validation. `garmy` reimplements SSO itself (doesn't depend on `garth`), so it isn't
automatically affected, but if Garmin's change is server-side it could hit `garmy` too. No
confirmed reports against `garmy` specifically as of this writing, and this environment has no
route to `garmin.com` to check directly — worth a quick look if sync starts failing with a 401
after a successful-looking login (as opposed to the MFA case above, which fails *during* login).

---

## 2. MCP Connection

StrideSync's MCP server is **read-only** — no write-back to Garmin Connect is planned for any
milestone below. Point an MCP client at the add-on's Streamable HTTP endpoint:

```
http://homeassistant.local:8765/mcp
```

(replace `homeassistant.local` with your HA server's hostname/IP, and `8765` with `mcp_port` if
you changed it from the default).

### Claude Desktop configuration

Claude Desktop speaks MCP over stdio to locally-launched processes, so connecting to a *remote*
Streamable HTTP server goes through `mcp-proxy` running as a local stdio↔HTTP bridge on your
machine (distinct from the `mcp-proxy` instance running *inside* the add-on, which bridges the
add-on's internal stdio-based MCP server to HTTP for the network hop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stridesync": {
      "command": "mcp-proxy",
      "args": [
        "http://homeassistant.local:8765/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Add this to Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`, restart Claude Desktop, and StrideSync's
tools/resources should appear in a new conversation.

## 3. Milestones

### v0.1 — Manual sync, verify schema 🔄

- ✅ `app/sync/garmin_client.py`: authenticate against Garmin Connect via `garmy`, wrapped so
  callers only ever see `GarminAuthError`/`GarminAPIError` (never a raw `garmy` or `requests`
  exception — see the module docstring for why transport-level failures needed their own
  handling, not just `garmy`'s own exception types)
- ✅ SQLite schema defined and created on first run (`activities`, `activity_metrics` as a
  per-lap time-series table for HR & pace, `sync_log`) — see `app/db/schema.sql`
- ✅ Manual sync runnable via CLI inside the container (`python3 -m app.sync.scheduler --once`)
  for verifying auth + schema without waiting on the scheduler
- ⬜ Inspect the resulting SQLite DB by hand to confirm the schema captures cadence, pace, HR,
  and training load fields Garmin actually returns — **still open**. `garmy`'s built-in
  activity summary has no distance/pace/cadence fields at all, so `garmin_client.py` merges it
  with the raw `/activity-service/activity/{id}` and `/activity-service/activity/{id}/splits`
  endpoints; the exact field names there (`summaryDTO`, `lapDTOs`, `averageRunningCadence...`)
  are inferred from the wider Garmin Connect tooling ecosystem, not confirmed against a live
  account — this dev environment has no route to `garmin.com` and no test credentials. Run
  `python3 -m app.sync.scheduler --once` against a real account and check
  `sqlite3 /data/stridesync.db` before ticking this off; adjust the field lookups in
  `garmin_client.py` if any come back `NULL` that shouldn't.
- ✅ CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): yamllint + hadolint + version-ordering check +
  Python syntax check + `pytest` + Docker build smoke test on every push/PR
- ✅ Release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): tags `stridesync/NEXT_VERSION`, builds
  and pushes multi-arch (`amd64`/`aarch64`) images to GHCR, creates a GitHub release, and opens
  the `chore/post-release` PR — see `CLAUDE.md`'s CI / Release section. Not yet run for a real
  release (that's v1.0's last checkbox).

### v0.2 — Scheduled sync service 🔄

- ✅ `rootfs/etc/services.d/sync-scheduler/run` — s6 service wrapping the scheduler loop
  (`app/sync/scheduler.py`'s `run_forever`), now exporting `garmin_username`/`garmin_password`/
  `sync_interval_hours`/`log_level` from `bashio::config` as env vars
- ✅ `sync_interval_hours` read from `/data/options.json` via `bashio::config`, default `6`
- 🔄 Sync runs continuously without manual invocation — verified by running
  `python3 -m app.sync.scheduler` directly (env vars set the way the s6 `run` script sets them)
  and confirming repeated sync passes + a clean exit within seconds of `SIGTERM` (not a multi-hour
  hang). **This caveat turned out to matter, twice**: `v0.1.0` shipped with a Dockerfile bug
  (`COPY app/ .` flattened the `app/` package into `WORKDIR`, breaking `python3 -m app.xxx` for
  both services — `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`) that only running-from-`stridesync/`
  local testing could never have caught, because locally `app/` is naturally a subdirectory.
  Fixed (`COPY app/ ./app/`), and CI's Docker build test now actually **runs** the built image
  and checks both services start, not just that the image builds. That new CI smoke test
  immediately caught a **second** bug on the same PR: `00-validate-config.sh` used
  `bashio::config.has_value`, which calls out to the Supervisor API and always reports values
  missing when there's no real Supervisor (standalone `docker run`) — it would have killed the
  container even with a correct `options.json`. Fixed (plain `bashio::config` + a shell
  emptiness check, matching the pattern the service `run` scripts already used successfully). A
  real HA instance / `docker restart` still hasn't been exercised (no Docker daemon in this
  sandbox); verify there before the next stable release if possible.
- ✅ `sync_log` populated on every run (success and failure paths) — covered by
  `tests/test_scheduler.py::TestRunForever`
- ✅ Graceful failure path exercised: a forced Garmin login failure (real SSO call blocked by this
  sandbox's network policy) confirmed the loop logs the failure, writes it to `sync_log`, and
  keeps running rather than crashing the service — both as a unit test
  (`test_auth_failure_does_not_crash_the_loop`) and live via the CLI

### v0.3 — MCP server over HTTP 🔄

- ✅ `app/mcp/server.py` — built directly on `fastmcp`, wired to the sync scheduler's SQLite DB
  over a read-only connection (see Architecture §1 for why `garmy-mcp`'s bundled server wasn't
  reused as-is)
- ✅ Streamable HTTP on `mcp_port` (default `8765`), served natively by `fastmcp`
  (`transport="http"`) — no `mcp-proxy` process runs inside the add-on (see Architecture §1)
- ✅ `rootfs/etc/services.d/mcp-server/run` — s6 service for the MCP server, independent of
  `sync-scheduler`, now exporting `mcp_port`/`log_level` from `bashio::config`
- 🔄 Tested end-to-end **with a real MCP client over real Streamable HTTP** (`fastmcp.Client`
  connecting to a live `python3 -m app.mcp.server` subprocess, listing tools and calling all
  five) — confirmed the full wire protocol works. **Not tested with Claude Desktop itself** — no
  desktop environment in this sandbox to run it; the config snippet in §2 is unverified against
  the real client.
- ✅ MCP tools cover: recent activities (`recent_activities`), pace/cadence/HR trend over a date
  range (`pace_cadence_hr_trend`), training load summary (`training_load_summary`), and
  last-sync status (`last_sync_status`) — plus `activity_laps` for per-lap detail within one
  activity

### v0.4 — HA Supervisor add-on packaging 🔄

- ✅ `stridesync/config.yaml` finalized: `options` + `schema` for all five settings in §1
- ✅ `stridesync/build.yaml` multi-arch (`aarch64`, `amd64`) pinned to a specific
  `ghcr.io/hassio-addons/base` tag (`18.0.1`) — implicitly verified: CI's Docker build test job
  has been building against this exact tag since v0.1 and passing on every PR
- ✅ `icon.png` (128×128) and `logo.png` (250×100) — a simple generated runner-glyph placeholder
  (flat teal background, white pictogram, "StrideSync" wordmark on the logo), replacing the 1×1
  scaffolding PNGs. Not professional artwork — reasonable to swap for real branding later, but no
  longer a placeholder that would look broken in the add-on store.
- ✅ Ingress: **revisited and added**, for exactly one browser-facing page — the one-time Garmin
  MFA login (`app/mfa_web/server.py`, see §1's "Known risk" section), for HA users without
  terminal/`docker exec` access. Originally skipped in this milestone (MCP clients reach the MCP
  server directly over the network, not through HA's UI, so ingress didn't fit that connection
  model) — that reasoning still holds for the MCP server itself, which has no ingress route.
- 🔄 `repository.yaml` is present and yamllint-clean, but **not verified against a real HA
  instance** — this sandbox has no Home Assistant Supervisor to add the repository to. Add
  `https://github.com/nsaputro/stride-sync` under **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ →
  Repositories** on a real HA instance to confirm HA recognizes it as a valid add-on source.
- ⬜ Full install-from-repository flow — **not done**. Needs a real HA instance and (until a
  release is tagged, see v1.0) a locally built image, since `stridesync/config.yaml`'s `image:`
  field points at a GHCR path with no pushed images yet. This is the main remaining gap before
  the add-on can genuinely be called "released" — see the Getting Started section for the
  standalone `docker build`/`docker run` steps that substitute for it pre-release.

### v1.0 — Documented, versioned, changelog-tracked release 🔄

- ✅ `DOCS.md` complete: install steps, all five config options, MCP connection instructions
  (`http://homeassistant.local:8765/mcp`), and the known-risk note about Garmin auth breakage
- ✅ `README.md` complete: accurate status (v0.1–v0.4 implemented, nothing released yet), a
  standalone Quick Start (`docker build`/`docker run`, no HA instance required), install
  instructions, config table, and the known-risk note
- ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` (root) and `stridesync/CHANGELOG.md` (add-on-local) populated for every
  milestone under `## [Unreleased]`, in Keep a Changelog format
- ✅ `stridesync/config.yaml` `version` (`0.0.0` — no release has shipped) and
  `stridesync/NEXT_VERSION` (`0.1.0` — next version to release) follow the versioning convention
  in `CLAUDE.md`
- ✅ Fixed a real bug in `.github/workflows/release.yml`'s post-release changelog script before
  it ever ran for real: simulated it against this repo's actual `CHANGELOG.md` and found the
  first-ever release (no prior version section, no prior git tag) both 404'd its own comparison
  link (`compare/v0.0.0...vX.Y.Z` — that tag was never created) and duplicated the version's
  trailing reference link in the generated `stridesync/CHANGELOG.md`. Fixed both; re-simulated a
  first release *and* a hypothetical second release (with a real prior tag) to confirm both
  paths now produce correct output.
- ⬜ First tagged GitHub release, images published to GHCR for `amd64` + `aarch64` — **not done,
  intentionally**. Running the release workflow publishes real public Docker images and a real
  GitHub release; that's a judgment call about readiness for the repo owner to make, not
  something to trigger unprompted. Once `stridesync/NEXT_VERSION` (`0.1.0`) is confirmed correct:
  **Actions → Release → Run workflow** on `main`. See `CLAUDE.md`'s CI / Release section.
